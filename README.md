# Image Filters
Set of Image filters done using Python programming language

## BWRGB
Image filter similar to Black and White filter, but in addition to shades of Black and White there are sahdes of Red, Green, and Blue. 

Here is example of changes that images go through when code is running

## BWCMY
Image filter similar to Black and White filter, but in addition to shades of Black and White there are shades of Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.

Here is example of changes that images go through when code is running

## CC
The algorithm chooses closest color in given set. Yellow, red and black colors were chosen as default colors.

Although for best result it is better to set colors manually, there is an option to set colors automatically by only setting number of desired colors. 

Here is example of changes that images go through when code is running (20 colors)
